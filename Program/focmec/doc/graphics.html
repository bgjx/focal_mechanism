<h2 align="center">Graphics in the <i>FOCMEC</i> package</h2>
As discussed in Section 3.2 in the manual, program <i>focplt</i> produces plots of focal-sphere projections of data and/or fault-plane solutions, and program <i>ratplt</i> is the ratio plotting program for the <i>FOCMEC</i> package.  Both use the SAC Graphics Format (SGF) to produce disk files.  Program <i>sgftops</i> converts .sgf files to postscript files.  The <i>FOCMEC</i> package can be compiled and run on &ldquo;big-endian&rdquo; systems (Sun Solaris, Mac OSX PPC) or &ldquo;little-dndian&rdquo; systems (Linux, Mac OSX i686/intel) that have the opposite byte order for binary data.  Because a .sgf file is a binary file, for earlier versions of this package, program <i>sgftops</i> would only work on a .sgf file that had one byte order.  Now the program works with either byte order.

Also included are four (Unix .csh) scripts:

<ol>
<li> <i>plsgf</i>: produces a print of a .sgf file.  
<li> <i>sgftoeps</i>: produces a EPS file (Encapsulated Postscript file) from a .sgf file.  Program <i>gs</i> is required. | (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghostscript" target="_blank">Resource page for <i>ghostscript</i></a>)
<li> <i>sgftopdf</i>: produces a PDF file from a .sgf file. Program <i>gs</i> and the Perl script <i>epstopdf</i> are required. | (<a href="http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/support/epstopdf" target="_blank">Web page for epstopdf</a>)
<li><i>sgftox</i>: displays a plot on the terminal.  As written, it uses <i>gs</i> to display the image.  The file is an ASCII text file, so one can replace <i>gs</i> with another program, such as <i>gv</i>, which is available on Unix platforms. | (<a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/gv/" target="_blank">Web page for <i>gv</i></a>).  If <i>gv</i> is in your path and you have a plot file in PDF format named <i>foo.pdf</i>, the command <i>gv foo.pdf</i> should display the plot.
</ol>

<p>To find out more the programs or scripts, enter the name with no arguments.</p>

<p>Several scripts in Section 4 run program <i>focplt</i> to produce SGF files.  Some of the scripts combine both data and solutions, and others combine different sets or representations of solutions, so studying them may be helpful regarding how one answers the prompts.  The screen output for these scripts is ported into a file named <i>a.junk</i> in the same directory, so if the script exits with an error message, comparing the contents of that file with the calling script should help the user find the error.</p>  

<p>If one wants to learnmore about SGF format, one might run program <i>./focmec/bin/vwbeetle</i> using the script <i>./focmec/tests/run_vwbeetle</i>.  The program produces the outline of a VW beetle in a .sgf file and converts the SGF file into <a href="./vwbeetle.pdf" target="_blank">a PDF file</a>.  The source code, </i>./focmec/src/vwbeetgle.f</i> shows how to create a .SGF file.  For more about SGF format, <a href="http://ds.iris.edu/files/sac-manual/manual/sgf_format.html" target="_blank">look at this page</a>.</p>

<p>  In program <i>focplt</i>, there is a prompt for adding labels to plots.  If one wishes to add a label that is more complicated than letters and numbers, it might be helpful to learn more about the <i>symbol</i> subroutine called by program <i>focplt</i>.  Script <i>./focmec/tests/run\_symdemo</i> produces a screen display and PDF file that shows the capabilities of the symbol subroutine.  <a href="./symbol.html" target="_blank">This file</a> has more information about the Symbol routine.
