 11 ratios, maximum of 10 with |o-c| diff >  0.8000    Focus VP/VS: 1.8225
For ratios,  0.100 = P radiation cutoff  0.100 = S radiation cutoff
 FLAG is NUM, DEN, N&D if n, d, both below curoff
 If FLAG N&D, total ratios used decreased by 1
 R Ac/Tot: # acceptable / total ratios minus M&D
 RMS Err: RMS of acceptable obs ratios
 AbsMaxDiff: max abs difference for ok solutions
 The minimum, increment and maximum B axis trend:    19.56    5.00   19.56
